        <h3>1. Get your online presence in place</h3>
        <p>
            If you're invested in getting a job in the information technology sector, you're going to want to be discoverable online.
            With that in mind, here are a few things that have worked for students in the past to develop an online persona that employers will love.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong class="font-black">Get a <a href="http://linkedin.com" class="font-black">LinkedIn</a> account.</strong> and completely fill it out
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect with your friends and colleagues on Linkedin, new friends, current employers, family, whatever. You never know which connections you might make!</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><strong class="font-black">Start a <a href="http://github.com" class="font-black">github</a> account.</strong> This one's a little more focused on those of you that want to code for a living, but nevertheless Github is a great place to showcase your coding skills to employers.</li>
            <li>
                <strong class="font-black">Have a personal website.</strong> Make sure that it showcases your digital portfolio, resume, and links to your linkedin and github accounts!
                <ol>
                    <li>To get you started:</li>
                    <li>Register a domain name like <i class="font-black">iamyourname.com</i> with a service like <a href="http://namecheap.com" class="font-black">namecheap.com</a> </li>
                    <li>Set up a hosting account (with the same company is always easiest) and put your website up! Whether its vanilla HTML, Wordpress, Drupal, or .Net - ask your fellow students for feedback and make it shine!</li>
                </ol>
            </li>


        </ol>
    </div>
