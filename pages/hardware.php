	<h2>What the group does</h2>
	<h3>Computer building</h3>
	<p>With you, we'll help you customize the computer you want. With the upcoming memory express discount, we will most likely be using the system configurator to build your computer.</p>
	<h3>Hardware Repair</h3> There is a limit to what we can repair, but at the Hardware Support Group, we'll try our best. We can try to diagnose the situation and what needs to be done to get it running again.
	<h3>Computer building tutorials</h3> We offer two main tutorials as well as the occasional specialized courses over the course of the semester.
	<h5>Beginners Tutorial</h5> How to build a simple computer.
	<h5>Advanced Tutorial</h5> Overclocking(CPU.GPU,RAM) In-depth hardware descriptions
	<h5>Specialized Tutorial</h5> Laptop Repairs by Logan Stein Turning your router into a repeater by Will Fowler.
